This simple Chrome extension makes better use of screen space while doing the New York Times crossword puzzle. 
Inspired by the layout of AcrossLite, you'll notice a more prominent and easier-to-read puzzle grid and reduced size of non-puzzle items (e.g. headers, banners, puzzle title, etc). 

#### Features:
+ Remove and collapse distracting banners including ads, options, and page headers
+ Give more space to the puzzle grid, allowing it to expand with your browser
+ Collapse puzzle details (e.g. title, date, and author) along with the puzzle toolbar (e.g. Settings, Rebus, Reset buttons) into a single line
+ Re-orient the Across and Down clue lists to be stacked instead of side-by-side (configurable via the options menu)
